# PentestingScript
Python implementation of penetration tests script inspired (and some parts I have "borrowed") by [kaboom](https://github.com/Leviathan36/kaboom).  
It consists of three phases:  
Information Gathering (IG) - using NMAP, metasploit  
Vulnerability Asessment (VA) - using Searchsploit, Metasploit, Nikto and Dirb  
Exploitation - Dictionary Attack (DA) - using Hydra and Medusa
